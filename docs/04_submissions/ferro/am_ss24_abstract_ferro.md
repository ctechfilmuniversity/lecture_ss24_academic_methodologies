# Title: 

A Review on AI's Environmental Impact and the Role of Communication

# Abstract

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are reshaping industry and everyday life, from autonomous driving technologies to turning text into images. But their transformative power is raising concerns about their environmental footprint. These systems consume vast computing resources, contributing to global warming through high carbon emissions, energy consumption, water use and the extraction of rare materials. Researchers are focusing on AIâ€™s sustainability in environmental, social and economic dimensions, highlighting the need for clear assessments. This paper examines key factors such as carbon footprint, energy consumption, water usage, and resource efficiency throughout the AI lifecycle, stressing the need for sustainable practices. It also addresses the challenge of raising public awareness and ensuring transparency. The study emphasises the need to strike a balance between innovation and sustainability in the development of AI.
