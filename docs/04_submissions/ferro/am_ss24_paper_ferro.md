### 01.02 Topic Selection

#### *Copyright with AI*

**What specifically interests you within that topic?**

This is a topic I had a lot of thoughts about while I was working on my First Term Project. Since I was using graffiti from other artists I was wondering if I could actually do it without their consent (outside of the educational purposes). I would be interested in doing a reasearch around this and see where are the limits/gaps.

**What further characteristics does the topic have?**

- Who owns the copyright of an AI generated image?
- How Ai-generated content impacts copyright laws 
- How existing laws adapt to AI generated artworks

**What questions could you ask about that topic?**

- Who holds the copyright for AI-generated content: the programmer, the user, or the AI itself?
- How do we balance protecting authors' rights while fostering innovation and access to AI technologies?
- Can current copyright frameworks adapt to AI generated artworks, or is there a need for new legislation?

**How could you solve those questions?**

- Multidisplinary approach involving legal analysis, technological understanding and ethical considerations
- Implementing technology-based solutions for tracking and managing ownership of AI-generated works.
- Developing new legal frameworks tailored to AI-generated content 


#### *New Media and Sustainability*

**What specifically interests you within that topic?**

This topic interests me because I try to be sustainable and I want to know how much my work effects the sustainability of the planet and I would love to know what can be done to work with new media in a sustainable way.

**What further characteristics does the topic have?**

- Ecological footprint of digital infrastructure
- New media as a way to raise awareness on sustainability
- Energy consumption of data centers
- The lifecycle of electronic devices
- Development of eco-friendly technologies

**What questions could you ask about that topic?**

- Do we know how much does our usage of new technologies impact the sustainability?
- Are new technologies sustainable?
- How can we make new technologies more sustainable?
- In what ways can digital technologies empower communities to adopt more sustainable practices? 

**How could you solve those questions?**

- Combination of theoretical research and practical case studies 
- Analyzing existing examples of new media initiatives focused on sustainability
- Conducting surveys or experiments to test the effectiveness of new media in changing environmental behaviors



#### *Visual Art and Blind People* 

**What specifically interests you within that topic?**

I would like to discover more on how blind people can experience visual artworks or and how it can be re-interpreted for them.
I'm interested in how art can transcend visual boundaries to become accessible and meaningful to all, regardless of sight

**What further characteristics does the topic have?**

- Sonification of images 
- Experience accessibility and limitations for blind people 
- Inclusivity in art education and galleries
- The psychological impact of engaging with art on blind people 
- The creative process behind producing art that is accessible to people without sight
- The creative process of producting visual art by blind people

**What questions could you ask about that topic?**

- How can museums and galleries become more accessible to blind visitors?
- What are the most effective ways to convey visual art to someone who has never seen?
- How can technology bridge the gap between traditional visual art forms and the sensory experiences of blind people?

**How could you solve those questions?**

- Both research and practical application
- Conducting interviews with blind people about their art experiences
- Studying existing accessible art programs
- Experimentation with different technologies like sound installations 


## Session 02
### 02.01 - The Storyline of Your Paper

1. What are the main challenges in making AI systems sustainable, and how are researchers addressing them?

2. How can public awareness and understanding of AI’s environmental impact be improved?

3. **What are the key properties in measuring sustainable AI systems, and how can innovative communication methods be developed to effectively convey the environmental footprint of AI technologies to the public, potentially using comparisons with more familiar metrics?**


## Session 04
### 04.01 Paper Methodology

La mia ricerca consisterà di due parti distinte: 
- nella prima andrò ad analizzare quali sono i fattori principali che determinano l'impatto ambientale dell'Intelligenza Artificiale. Per farlo proporrò una lista dei fattori con una breve spiegazione di come influiscono e, quando possibile, fornirò dei dati quantitativi a sostegno della tesi. 
- nella seconda parte presenterò una proposta per comunicare i dati racconti al meglio per il pubblico generale, per farlo presenterò un'idea di comunicazione e fornirò una spiegazione del perchè penso possa essere efficace.  

## Session 05
### 05.01 Paper Knowledge and Results 

Come risultato finale del mio paper mi piacerebbe riuscire a fornire una lista chiara e ben definita di quali siano i fattori principali che deterinano l'impatto ambientale dell'Intelligenza Artificiale. Mi piacerebbe realizzare anche una info grafica che visualizzi i vari fattori, magari anche in proporzione. Mi piacerebbe anche fornire una chiarificazione su quali dati siano ancora abbastanza oscuri al pubblico. Per la seconda parte del paper vorrei riuscire ad arrivare con una idea completa e quindi anche con il risultato visivo, non solo concettualmente.

## Session 06
### 06.01 Working with Literature 

I've decided to keep track of my literature using JabRef.

## Session 07
### 07.01 Reflection on past experiences

What worked well and what didn't:

- structure/layout of the thesis was weak and I changed it constantly while writing 
- I could easily rewrite what other said 
- Once I knew what I needed to write I could write for hours and get a well job done
- Finding synonims and not repeating myself was difficult 
- I had my notes well structured and this helped me a lot with writing, but I think I relied on my literature too much 

## Session 08
### 08.01 Abstract 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are reshaping industry and everyday life, from autonomous driving technologies to turning text into images. But their transformative power is raising concerns about their environmental footprint. These systems consume vast computing resources, contributing to global warming through high carbon emissions, energy consumption, water use and the extraction of rare materials. Researchers are focusing on AI’s sustainability in environmental, social and economic dimensions, highlighting the need for clear assessments. This paper examines key factors such as carbon footprint, energy consumption, water usage, and resource efficiency throughout the AI lifecycle, stressing the need for sustainable practices. It also addresses the challenge of raising public awareness and ensuring transparency. The study emphasises the need to strike a balance between innovation and sustainability in the development of AI.
