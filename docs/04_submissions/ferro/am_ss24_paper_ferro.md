## Copyright with AI

**What specifically interests you within that topic?**

This is a topic I had a lot of thoughts about while I was working on my First Term Project. Since I was using graffiti from other artists I was wondering if I could actually do it without their consent (outside of the educational purposes). I would be interested in doing a reasearch around this and see where are the limits/gaps.

**What further characteristics does the topic have?**

- Who owns the copyright of an AI generated image?
- How Ai-generated content impacts copyright laws 
- How existing laws adapt to AI generated artworks

**What questions could you ask about that topic?**

- Who holds the copyright for AI-generated content: the programmer, the user, or the AI itself?
- How do we balance protecting authors' rights while fostering innovation and access to AI technologies?
- Can current copyright frameworks adapt to AI generated artworks, or is there a need for new legislation?

**How could you solve those questions?**

- Multidisplinary approach involving legal analysis, technological understanding and ethical considerations
- Implementing technology-based solutions for tracking and managing ownership of AI-generated works.
- Developing new legal frameworks tailored to AI-generated content 


## New Media and Sustainability

**What specifically interests you within that topic?**
This topic interests me because I try to be sustainable and I want to know how much my work effects the sustainability of the planet and I would love to know what can be done to work with new media in a sustainable way.

**What further characteristics does the topic have?**

- Ecological footprint of digital infrastructure
- New media as a way to raise awareness on sustainability
- Energy consumption of data centers
- The lifecycle of electronic devices
- Development of eco-friendly technologies

**What questions could you ask about that topic?**

- Do we know how much does our usage of new technologies impact the sustainability?
- Are new technologies sustainable?
- How can we make new technologies more sustainable?
- In what ways can digital technologies empower communities to adopt more sustainable practices? 

**How could you solve those questions?**

- Combination of theoretical research and practical case studies 
- Analyzing existing examples of new media initiatives focused on sustainability
- Conducting surveys or experiments to test the effectiveness of new media in changing environmental behaviors



## Visual Art and Blind People

**What specifically interests you within that topic?**

I would like to discover more on how blind people can experience visual artworks or and how it can be re-interpreted for them.
I'm interested in how art can transcend visual boundaries to become accessible and meaningful to all, regardless of sight

**What further characteristics does the topic have?**

- Sonification of images 
- Experience accessibility and limitations for blind people 
- Inclusivity in art education and galleries
- The psychological impact of engaging with art on blind people 
- The creative process behind producing art that is accessible to people without sight
- The creative process of producting visual art by blind people

**What questions could you ask about that topic?**

- How can museums and galleries become more accessible to blind visitors?
- What are the most effective ways to convey visual art to someone who has never seen?
- How can technology bridge the gap between traditional visual art forms and the sensory experiences of blind people?

**How could you solve those questions?**

- Both research and practical application
- Conducting interviews with blind people about their art experiences
- Studying existing accessible art programs
- Experimentation with different technologies like sound installations
