# Possible Topics - Maximilian Rueth

## Session 01 
### Brainstorming

motion capture libraries

motion capture with ai

ai as an an animation tool 

new media for theatre performances

animation pipline for real life interaction

motion capture for medical purposes

VR with therapeutic effect

Parametric structures from nature in a design context


### Topic 1: Motion Capture for medical purposes

* What specifically interests you within that topic? 

   At MLU, I sat in a room with a computer scientist who was conducting experiments on precisely this question. I'm interested in how this aspect, which actually comes from the film industry, can be used in a medical context.

* What further characteristics does the topic have? 

    - How can doctors determine what the patient is missing by analyzing the movements?

    - Which systems are best suited for this
    


* What questions could you ask about that topic? 

    - How can doctors determine what the patient is missing by analyzing the movements?
    - How much demand is there for this topic/what relevance will it have in the future?
    - What systems can be used or are already used for this?
    - What are the limitations?

* How could you solve those questions? 

    - analysing already exisiting projects
    - maybe having interviews with professional who already worked such projects
    - analysing testimonial regarding this topic


  
### Topic 2: VR with therapeutic effect

* What specifically interests you within that topic? 

   - Apparently, a VR application has been developed in Canada to help cancer patients cope better with the pain of treatment or to alleviate phantom limb pain in amputees.

* What further characteristics does the topic have? 

    - the developed content
    - characteristics of the content (has it something to do with the topic, or is it for example only pleasant animation)
    - understanding the user journey

* What questions could you ask about that topic? 

    - What do you have to consider when developing such content?
    - What content gets displayed?
    - Is the medium really suited for this?

* How could you solve those questions? 

    - analysing already exisiting projects
    - maybe having interviews with professional who already worked such projects

  
### Topic 3: Motion Capture Libraries in the age of AI

* What specifically interests you within that topic? 

    - Nowadays there is a vast among of animation libraries with pre-captured movements and it's still expanding. Some people say that in the near future, classic motion capture might become irrelevant. AI may reinforce this development even more.

* What further characteristics does the topic have? 
  - the systems/softwares that are used or are relevant
  - AI development in that regard

    

* What questions could you ask about that topic? 
  - How do these systems/libraries operate?
  - What could be the development over the next years?

   
* How could you solve those questions? 
  - analysing already existing applications
  - review papers that talk about this topic 

## Session 02
### The Storyline of Your Paper

Because I'm still unsure about my exact topic, I did'nt create a storyline for now and wanted to research a bit more for this session and ask myself what really interests me and what I personally want from the paper.

## Session 04
### Paper Methodology

For this session I decided to do a bit more research about different Motion Capture methods, that have a "unique" approach in some way. Maybe I find a new method or something that still lacks some of its key elements or as some errors. Maybe my paper could be about solving these errors.


## Session 06
### Qualitative Research - Results

My idea for the paper would be to do research on some unique motion capture approaches and compare them to each other in my paper. I would propably like to rate them in a way, but I would have to come up with a system first.

## Session 07
### Working with Literature

I decided to focus on the topic of "Animal Motion Capture". There are some really interesting and unique approaches, which are also not that well known. Especially when you think about the pipline for films, it might have some potential.

## Potenital Research Question
### (still a prototyp)

What are the technological challenges and (modern) possibilities in Motion Capture systems for animals in a cinematographic context?

## Abstract
### Title: Beyond Human Motion: Exploring Advanced Techniques and Challenges in Animal Motion Capture for Cinematography

Animal motion capture in cinematography presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving non-invasive tracking while maintaining natural behaviors. Although human motion capture has seen considerable advancements, applying similar techniques to animals requires innovative solutions. This paper explores a variety of methods, including markerless capture systems for underwater creatures, long-range data collection for wildlife, and advanced tracking approaches for large four-legged animals. Through a comparative analysis, we evaluate these methodsâ€™ effectiveness and potential integration into cinematic works while revealing their limitations. Further advancements are essential, particularly in improving accessibility, enhancing automation, and addressing ethical considerations, to ensure these technologies can be more broadly and effectively applied across the film industry and enhance the realism and immersion of animal portrayals in cinema.
