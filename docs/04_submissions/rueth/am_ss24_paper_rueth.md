# Possible Topics - Maximilian Rueth


### Brainstorming

motion capture libraries

motion capture with ai

ai as an an animation tool 

new media for theatre performances

animation pipline for real life interaction

motion capture for medical purposes

VR with therapeutic effect

Parametric structures from nature in a design context


### Topic 1: Motion Capture for medical purposes

* What specifically interests you within that topic? 

   At MLU, I sat in a room with a computer scientist who was conducting experiments on precisely this question. I'm interested in how this aspect, which actually comes from the film industry, can be used in a medical context.

* What further characteristics does the topic have? 

    - How can doctors determine what the patient is missing by analyzing the movements?

    - Which systems are best suited for this
    


* What questions could you ask about that topic? 

    - How can doctors determine what the patient is missing by analyzing the movements?
    - How much demand is there for this topic/what relevance will it have in the future?
    - What systems can be used or are already used for this?
    - What are the limitations?

* How could you solve those questions? 

    - analysing already exisiting projects
    - maybe having interviews with professional who already worked such projects
    - analysing testimonial regarding this topic

### Topic 2: VR with therapeutic effect

* What specifically interests you within that topic? 

   - Apparently, a VR application has been developed in Canada to help cancer patients cope better with the pain of treatment or to alleviate phantom limb pain in amputees.

* What further characteristics does the topic have? 

    - the developed content
    - characteristics of the content (has it something to do with the topic, or is it for example only pleasant animation)
    - understanding the user journey

* What questions could you ask about that topic? 

    - What do you have to consider when developing such content?
    - What content gets displayed?
    - Is the medium really suited for this?

* How could you solve those questions? 

    - analysing already exisiting projects
    - maybe having interviews with professional who already worked such projects

### Topic 3: Motion Capture Libraries in the age of AI

* What specifically interests you within that topic? 

    - Nowadays there is a vast among of animation libraries with pre-captured movements and it's still expanding. Some people say that in the near future, classic motion capture might become irrelevant. AI may reinforce this development even more.

* What further characteristics does the topic have? 
  - the systems/softwares that are used or are relevant
  - AI development in that regard

    

* What questions could you ask about that topic? 
  - How do these systems/libraries operate?
  - What could be the development over the next years?

   
* How could you solve those questions? 
  - analysing already existing applications
  - review papers that talk about this topic
