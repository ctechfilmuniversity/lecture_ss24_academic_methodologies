### Topic 1: Color Pipelines in ICVFX Virtual Production

* What specifically interests you within that topic? 

    The general interest in ICVFX but also the relevance and aplicability of this topic makes it interesting for me. Furthermore, there is a secrecy surrounding this topic that could indicate that current pipelines are somewhat hacky.

* What further characteristics does the topic have? 

    Beyond juggling color spaces, gammuts and temperatures between the software settings of multiple devices this topic also entails physical properties of LED Volumes. For instance, how to work with color shifts that occur due to steep camera angles, wall-overheating, or the progressing age of the LED panels.

* What questions could you ask about that topic? 

    What pipelines can be used and what are the pitfalls and limitations of each?

* How could you solve those questions? 

    I could approach those questions by repetitive color tests on the LED stage during April 2024 as well as interviews with exprienced ICVFX DITs and VP-Supervisors.

### Topic 2: The Power of Previz in ICVFX Virtual Production

* What specifically interests you within that topic? 

    The general interest in ICVFX but also the relevance and aplicability of this topic makes it interesting for me. Furthermore, the work with previz and the knowled gained through them is easily misunderstood.

* What further characteristics does the topic have? 

    The benefits of pre-visualization could be estimated in production costs but much more at focus for me would be how some creative processes are shifted into unusual production stages. This can be followed by essential consequneces as the two fundamentally different working cultures of software developers and filmmakers meet.

* What questions could you ask about that topic? 

    How can we understand new collaborative workflows that makes use of the full benefit that virtual production can offer?

* How could you solve those questions? 

    I could approach those questions by documenting my experiences in several virtual productions as well as interviewing exprienced VP-Supervisors.

### Topic 2: Bringing High-Fidelity Graphics and Actor Performances into Standalone VR

* What specifically interests you within that topic? 

    These are currently the exact topics that I'll face in the production of the VR-experience "Der Fliegende Holl√§nder". This will most likely be my masters thesis project for the studies of creative technologies. 

* What further characteristics does the topic have? 

    Firstly, I see potential in coding an automatisation for Blender3D where high-complexity photogrammetric scans are baked into simple planes with light-reactive normal maps. Secondly, I'd like to showcase a 2,5D architecture inside the engine that gives good-enough parallax for 6-DoF VR. And lastly, I would like to explore alternatives to volumetric filmmaking where eiher more primitive or AI-gerneated depth maps can sufficiently add depth to a two-dimensional keyed green-screen video plane as well as possibilities of fine tuning (or tricking) lighting to merge actor footage with CG environments.

* What questions could you ask about that topic? 

    What aspects of high-fidelity CGI come across in VR more than others?
    What workflows focus more on those stronger perceivable aspects and shortcut unneccessary work?
    Considering all this, how can the visual elements be optimized to run on low-performing devices such as standalone VR?
    How can we spatially design VR environments in smart ways?

* How could you solve those questions? 

    Primarely, I see quite much technical R&D with multiple test iterations until I could securely tell if I have found a way to answer the questions qualitatively using my own single example.
