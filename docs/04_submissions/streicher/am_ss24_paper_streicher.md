### Topic: Color Pipelines in ICVFX Virtual Production

* What specifically interests you within that topic? 

    The general interest in ICVFX but also the relevance and aplicability of this topic makes it interesting for me. Furthermore, there is a secrecy surrounding this topic that could indicate that current pipelines are somewhat hacky.

* What further characteristics does the topic have? 

    Beyond juggling color spaces, gammuts and temperatures between the software settings of multiple devices this topic also entails physical properties of LED Volumes. For instance, how to work with color shifts that occur due to steep camera angles, wall-overheating, or the progressing age of the LED panels.

* What questions could you ask about that topic? 

    What pipelines can be used and what are the pitfalls and limitations of each?

* How could you solve those questions? 

    I could approach those questions by repetitive color tests on the LED stage during April 2024 as well as interviews with exprienced ICVFX DITs and VP-Supervisors.
