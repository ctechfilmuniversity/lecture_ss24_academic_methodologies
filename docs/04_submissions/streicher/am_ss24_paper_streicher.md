## Along the Way of Finding my Knowledge Gap & Research Question

Initial Thought:
- "Previz for ICVFX" needs more Specification

First Approach:
- check out related Literature

Findings:
- skimmed through nine papers, thee books and two MA thesis
- current release date is a very high indicator of relevance
- there is literature & papers about
	- previsualization in the context of film production, VFX or general filmmaking
	- particular techniques for previz (VR/MR)
	- generally virtual production
	- a lot of mentioning how previz generally help productions
- I found nothing on how precisely previsualizations can be utilized/beneficial for ICVFX productions

Thoughts:
- If there is nothing, is the topic relevant or redundant?
- I would need to be clear on how ICVFX as a subcategory differs
- I could focus on how videomatics as a form of previz can benefit ICVFX productions based on two very different use cases that I was involved with
- is this still too broad or just fine?

___

Next Step:
- answer general topic questions

**What's the topic?**

	Videomatics as a creative and technical preparation tool for ICVFX virtual production.

**What specifically interests you within that topic?**

	With my background in cinematography and game development virtual production is the most
    natural fusion of my fields of interests, especially ICVFX. I have experienced it twice how 
    much knowledge and confidence can be gained through a videomatic. I feel the urge to share 
    that experience and make it more accessable, especially in a confusing field such as virtual 
    production.

**What further characteristics does the topic have?**

    The creation of a videomatic is not only useful as an artifact of reference but also through 
    its very creation process. Creating a low-pressure environment without a big crew where 
    creativity comes naturally can lead to excellent dynamics. A production of a videomatic also 
    entails a switch from linear film production to an iterative process where many aspects of 
    the film can be reflected, revisited, and improved.

**What questions could you ask about that topic?**

	What exact characteristics and challenges of ICVFX need special attention?
	How can an ICVFX production benefit from videomatics?
	What types of videomatics can be utilized?

**How could you solve those questions?**

    Compare the prerquisites and production processes of two videomatic case studies and analize 
    for patterns that relate to the questions.

___

Next Step:
- note topics I want to include
- note topics I want to exclude
- note title ideas

#### Topics to include:

- creative limitations when working on an ICVFX set
- videomatic as a previs for ICVFX 
	- technical varriety of videomatics: life action - virtual - performance capture - etc.
- videomatics as a creative exploration (playground) before facing set
- technical knowledge-gathering
	- light direction
	- safe areas for camera angles etc.
- breaking linearity of the filmmaking process
	- iterative shaping process
- focus on convenience, advantages and benefits
- differences of the two videomatics
	- intention and focus
	- action-focused vs dialogue-heavy
	- time spent
	- processes & practice
	- level of stylization / abstractions
	- demonstration through artefacts

#### Topics to exclude:

- economic analysis of VP film production
- end result artifact of the movie

#### Title Ideas:

"Videomatics as a creative and technical playground for a better ICVFX virtual production"

"Minimize technical challenges in ICVFX using videomatics"

"Videomatics for ICVFX virtual production. A comparative case study of methods and advantages."

"How to benefit from previsualization in virtual production. A comparative case study of 
videomatic productions for ICVFX"


Next Step:
- organize artefact through inductive coding
	- possible tags: art, narrative, camera, tech



## Along the Way of Finding my Research Format & Framework


Initial Thoughts:
- I plan on writing a paper in the field of CGI & VP
- I'm not sure about format of paper (case study or state-of-the-art?)
- I'm thinking of writing about previz for ICVFX - I have done this twice for in very different ways
- I could possibly compare those in a paper

First Approach:
- look for research concepts in internet / LLMs

Findings:
- state-of-the-art report is the wrong format for comparing artifacts
- **case study** as qualitative research with focus on a specific instance or example within a real-world context might be best approach

 Next Step:
 - get hands on the book "Research for Designer: A guide to methods and practice" by G. Muratovski and read related chapters

Findings:
- there is "applied research" and "case studies"
- case studies can have **comparative analysis** part within the format of a **collective case study**
	- two different examples can be brought together and compared
	- can be problem-oriented or source-oriented research
		- problem-oriented: issue examined by other sources without first-hand record of it
		- source-oriented: source material motivates research
	- case studies don't aim for generalization
	- the final writing is often distributed in:
		- introduction 15%
		- data 20%
		- data analysis 35%
		- discussion 20%
		- conclusion 10%
- applied research is practice driven
	- is considered with purpose, context, rationale and sometimes artifacts
	- focus is more on process than output

Thoughts:
- I'm unsure what of the two categories would be a better framework for my paper
- pro applied research: its usability and focus on process is closer to what I strive for
- anti applied research: for generalization my research is not elaborate enough and sample size is too low
- I'm leaning towards the case study format
	- could be problem-oriented research
	- motive: how to prepare for the technical challenges of ICVFX
	- my research question is not clear enough yet to decide definitely


## Previous Topic

#### Topic: Color Pipelines in ICVFX Virtual Production

* What specifically interests you within that topic? 

    The general interest in ICVFX but also the relevance and aplicability of this topic makes it interesting for me. Furthermore, there is a secrecy surrounding this topic that could indicate that current pipelines are somewhat hacky.

* What further characteristics does the topic have? 

    Beyond juggling color spaces, gammuts and temperatures between the software settings of multiple devices this topic also entails physical properties of LED Volumes. For instance, how to work with color shifts that occur due to steep camera angles, wall-overheating, or the progressing age of the LED panels.

* What questions could you ask about that topic? 

    What pipelines can be used and what are the pitfalls and limitations of each?

* How could you solve those questions? 

    I could approach those questions by repetitive color tests on the LED stage during April 2024 as well as interviews with exprienced ICVFX DITs and VP-Supervisors.

____

#### Research Question:

What discrepencies in color processing are connected to live rendering HDR content from Unreal Engine to an LED volume?



____

#### Methodology:

* run tests & analayse
* qualitative interviews

____

#### Sources:

##### Multispectral Lighting Reproduction
