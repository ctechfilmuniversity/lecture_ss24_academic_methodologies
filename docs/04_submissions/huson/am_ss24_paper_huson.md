# Research Paper 
## Task 01.02 - Topic Selection

### Idea #1: Real-time Motion Capture in Theatre
The avatar (doppelganger) and the artist. 
- What kind of art can be created between an actor and their doppelganger? Is there precedent? 
- The actor as the puppeteer of avatars
- Real time avatars in theatrical contexts - technical setups, precedent, artistic possibilities,... 
- https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/theater/at-this-tempest-digital-wizardry-makes-rough-magic.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer

What specifically interests you within that topic? 
* Precedent: which theatre productions have used real-time motion capture? The most famous seems to be the Royal Shakespeare Company's 2016 production of "The Tempest" (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/theater/at-this-tempest-digital-wizardry-makes-rough-magic.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer). 
* Technical workflow, pipeline, etc. 
* Artistic possibilities
* Lineage: what theatrical tools and aesthetics might real-time motion capture extend, build upon, constrast, etc. 
What further characteristics does the topic have? 
* Financial: theatres generally don't have much money, but with the price of motion capture plummeting, we could see more theatre's harness this new technology
* viewing habits: how do audiences view an avatar representation vs the performer, how can directors incorporate this technology and guide the audience's attention as in "analog" productions?  
What questions could you ask about that topic? 
* What are the technical challenges of real-time motion capture use and how can we overcome them?
* How can real-time motion capture be incorporated? What staging possibilites are there? 
* How did "The Tempest" (RSC, 2016) make use of real-time motion capture? What was their artistic approach, how much can be found out about their technical setup? 
How could you solve those questions? 
* Come up and test a workflow for real-time mocap
* Write a treatment for a stage production that uses real-time mocap
* Research previous plays
* Research and compare other theatrical technologies: puppeteering, mirrors, etc. 

### Idea #2: Digital Perservation of Disappearing Ecologies

What specifically interests you within that topic? 
* I'm interested in the works of Marshmallow Laser Feast, Jakob Kudsk Steensen, the Godwana VR experience, etc. which try to capture fragile ecosystems so that audiences might expand their understanding of the natural world and perhaps care more for it. At the same time, these works can be viewed as virtual archives, which may become the only way to experience the fragile ecosystems they depict and artistically alter. A more pragmatic example of this is the plan of Tuvalu's government to create a digital twin of the island so that future generations may view what the nation used to look like. I'm interested in the artistic approaches, the methods used to preserve (audio recordings, photogrammetry, etc.) and the societal impact: is this a way of dealing with solastalgia, or is it yet another form of distraction from the hard work needed to try and save what we can? Adjacent to digital preservation is the the idea of digital mourning: what if the whole world could mourn the disappearance of a glacier which has a digital twin of it? What role can the artist play, etc.? 
What further characteristics does the topic have? 
* There are many further characteristics, such as technical, societal, historical factors. 
What questions could you ask about that topic? 
* state-of-the-art: examination of works that have dealt with this topic
* how are these acts of digital preservation framed? 
* what kind of tools do we have for immersive preservation? How can we expand them?
How could you solve those questions? 
* Research different experiences
* Research different field recording techniques and how they can be extended, what about using different kinds of data, etc. what precedent is there...

### Idea #3: What is happening with performers in the age of AI? 

What specifically interests you within that topic? 
* With deepfakes only getting better, it is crucial that we think about how performers will deal with this. Things like DrakeGPT and Infinite Grimes show us that we need new ways of dealing with IP. A large chunk of responsibility resides in governments, but creative technologists have to proactively work on this too. A great example is Holly+ by Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst. Holly+ is an artistic tool and economic model that allows the singer to profit from other people using her voice in their work. Holly Herndon coins the term IP as in Identity Play to refer to this new terrain. What other models exist, how are they received, etc. 
What further characteristics does the topic have? 
* What kind of economic models can be created around this? 
* How do you prevent people from misusing these tools? 
* What are the environmental costs of these tools? Streaming has already made music far more harmful to the environment than it used to be. 
What questions could you ask about that topic? 
* State-of-the-art: what approaches exist, who uses them and how? 
* The artist and their digital twin: what artistic and financial potential exists in the use of AI-powered digital twins of artists? 
* ...
How could you solve those questions? 
* Research! Conceptualize! Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst live in Berlin, maybe if I'm lucky enough I could interview them.

## Research Question 

I've strayed from my original ideas after reading about "The Internet of Animals" and have decided to explore the possibilities artists might have in using the plethora of animal and other nonhuman data that is becoming accessible to the public. I have three variations of more or less the same question and am not sure which one to pursue further. Appreciate the feedback! 

- “Data Art: Crafting Nonhuman Dramaturgies using the *Movebank* Database” 

- “How can Artists use the Movebank Database to Craft Artistic Experiences of the Nonhuman World?”

- “Applications of the Movebank Database in Creating Artistic Experiences Centred Around Nonhuman Beings”

### Feedback Lena

* First of all, I think this is a great direction, very interesting.
* Are you planning to research other people's dramaturgies or how others craft artistic experiences with Movebank and summarize those or are you planning to come up with your own ideas - or both?
* Option 1 is my favorite as the term "dramaturgy" is too me clearer than "artistic experience". I am not sure though what "Nonhuman Dramaturgies" should be? The dramaturgies are still from humans and for humans but are based on nonhuman data? Or are you looking for existing dramaturgies (or something similar) within the nonhuman data? If the former maybe make it a bit clearer along the lines of “Data Art: Crafting Theatrical Dramaturgies with Nonhuman data from the *Movebank* Database” (in case you want it in a theatrical context of course). Do you want to also include technical considerations and descriptions? 
* Why not simply call the "nonhuman" "animals"? The data is all animals, right? But I understand that "animals" would read less poetic - but clearer ;)
* I also like the focus in option 3 that the result should highlight the "nonhuman beings"
* I think you are in good place with these questions. Now you need to decide on what it is you actually want to investigate (other people's work, come up with your own ideas, both, one idea e.g. as case study vs. many ideas and options as an overview (would still be called case study though), come up with a taxonomy / hierarchy, technical insights, insights on the perception of the audience, focus on the communication of the data etc. ). Once you made this decision, you should shape the question accordingly.

## Session 04 - Statistics - Methodology  
I aim to examine different artworks which make use of data of the nonhuman world, whether it be animal tracking data, scans, etc. Using a theoretical framework, I then examine these artworks in order to understand their dramaturgy, i.e. their narrative scaffolding. I've been collecting different papers, essay and artworks and am thinking about which theories and defintions to use as well as which artworks to analyse. 

## Session 05 - Qualitative Research - Results
I want to present a perspective on data art that is grounded in different theories applied to different works. In the best case, I come up with some new idea on the form of data art as it relates to the nonhuman world. 

## Session 06 - Working With Literature 
"Defining Data as an Art Material" - PhD Thesis (2018) by Julie Freeman, Queen Mary University of London 
- Julie Freeman is a data artist who, in her own words, "translates nature". Both her artwork and her PhD will provide very useful to my paper. She views data as an art material, which I might base my theoretical conception of data in art around. Her artworks are great examples of how data provides a different lens through which to view the other-than-human world and allows for new ways of telling stories. 

Sørensen, V., Lansing, J. Art, technology and the Internet of Living Things. AI & Soc 38, 2401–2417 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-023-01667-4
- This paper provides a lot of interesting artworks for me to reference. Also, the idea of the Internet of Living Things (in a slightly different context also referred to as The Internet of Animals) might provide useful to my research. 

"Data Visualisation as New Abstraction and Anti-Sublime" by Lev Manovich 2002 
- Lev Manovich's conception of data visualisation, along with Freeman's ideas, will probably make up my perspective of data art in the paper to begin with. 

Here's a link to the papers, interviews, videos, etc. I've collected thusfar for AM: https://www.are.na/moritz-h/ctech-ss-24-academic-methodologies

# Session 07 - Abstract
Abstract (to be inserted into LaTex document): Human perception inherently limits our ability to comprehend other-than-human beings, leading to the anthropomorphisation of these entities in our fictional narratives. This paper introduces the concept of "datamorphisation" to describe the shift in perspective that occurs when the (fictional) representation of an entity is constructed through data collected about it. Unlike anthropomorphising, which imposes human characteristics onto non-human entities, datamorphising both simplifies and broadens our conceptualisation of these entities. This paper explores the mechanics of datamorphisation in data art focused on other-than-human beings, employing exemplary artworks as case studies. By using data collected on the activities of beings that elude our fundamental understanding, I argue that we gain an additional perspective through datamorphising, complementing the anthropomorphic viewpoint.
