# Research Paper 
## Task 01.02 - Topic Selection

### Idea #1: Real-time Motion Capture in Theatre
The avatar (doppelganger) and the artist. 
- What kind of art can be created between an actor and their doppelganger? Is there precedent? 
- The actor as the puppeteer of avatars
- Real time avatars in theatrical contexts - technical setups, precedent, artistic possibilities,... 
- https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/theater/at-this-tempest-digital-wizardry-makes-rough-magic.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer

What specifically interests you within that topic? 
* Precedent: which theatre productions have used real-time motion capture? The most famous seems to be the Royal Shakespeare Company's 2016 production of "The Tempest" (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/theater/at-this-tempest-digital-wizardry-makes-rough-magic.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer). 
* Technical workflow, pipeline, etc. 
* Artistic possibilities
* Lineage: what theatrical tools and aesthetics might real-time motion capture extend, build upon, constrast, etc. 
What further characteristics does the topic have? 
* Financial: theatres generally don't have much money, but with the price of motion capture plummeting, we could see more theatre's harness this new technology
* viewing habits: how do audiences view an avatar representation vs the performer, how can directors incorporate this technology and guide the audience's attention as in "analog" productions?  
What questions could you ask about that topic? 
* What are the technical challenges of real-time motion capture use and how can we overcome them?
* How can real-time motion capture be incorporated? What staging possibilites are there? 
* How did "The Tempest" (RSC, 2016) make use of real-time motion capture? What was their artistic approach, how much can be found out about their technical setup? 
How could you solve those questions? 
* Come up and test a workflow for real-time mocap
* Write a treatment for a stage production that uses real-time mocap
* Research previous plays
* Research and compare other theatrical technologies: puppeteering, mirrors, etc. 

### Idea #2: Digital Perservation of Disappearing Ecologies

What specifically interests you within that topic? 
* I'm interested in the works of Marshmallow Laser Feast, Jakob Kudsk Steensen, the Godwana VR experience, etc. which try to capture fragile ecosystems so that audiences might expand their understanding of the natural world and perhaps care more for it. At the same time, these works can be viewed as virtual archives, which may become the only way to experience the fragile ecosystems they depict and artistically alter. A more pragmatic example of this is the plan of Tuvalu's government to create a digital twin of the island so that future generations may view what the nation used to look like. I'm interested in the artistic approaches, the methods used to preserve (audio recordings, photogrammetry, etc.) and the societal impact: is this a way of dealing with solastalgia, or is it yet another form of distraction from the hard work needed to try and save what we can? Adjacent to digital preservation is the the idea of digital mourning: what if the whole world could mourn the disappearance of a glacier which has a digital twin of it? What role can the artist play, etc.? 
What further characteristics does the topic have? 
* There are many further characteristics, such as technical, societal, historical factors. 
What questions could you ask about that topic? 
* state-of-the-art: examination of works that have dealt with this topic
* how are these acts of digital preservation framed? 
* what kind of tools do we have for immersive preservation? How can we expand them?
How could you solve those questions? 
* Research different experiences
* Research different field recording techniques and how they can be extended, what about using different kinds of data, etc. what precedent is there...

### Idea #3: What is happening with performers in the age of AI? 

What specifically interests you within that topic? 
* With deepfakes only getting better, it is crucial that we think about how performers will deal with this. Things like DrakeGPT and Infinite Grimes show us that we need new ways of dealing with IP. A large chunk of responsibility resides in governments, but creative technologists have to proactively work on this too. A great example is Holly+ by Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst. Holly+ is an artistic tool and economic model that allows the singer to profit from other people using her voice in their work. Holly Herndon coins the term IP as in Identity Play to refer to this new terrain. What other models exist, how are they received, etc. 
What further characteristics does the topic have? 
* What kind of economic models can be created around this? 
* How do you prevent people from misusing these tools? 
* What are the environmental costs of these tools? Streaming has already made music far more harmful to the environment than it used to be. 
What questions could you ask about that topic? 
* State-of-the-art: what approaches exist, who uses them and how? 
* The artist and their digital twin: what artistic and financial potential exists in the use of AI-powered digital twins of artists? 
* ...
How could you solve those questions? 
* Research! Conceptualize! Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst live in Berlin, maybe if I'm lucky enough I could interview them.
