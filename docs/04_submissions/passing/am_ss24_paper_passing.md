# Task 01 - Topic Brainstorming & Topic Selection

- Implementation of some algorithm in Rust

  What the title says, because I think Rust is super exciting for this field of study

- Deep dive into plant interaction / installations including plants

  Clearly inspired by our collab project. I want to research some more ways of how artists have used plants and/or plant data in installations or performances that go beyond "touch".

- Digitally enhanced audience participation for theater performances

  I have some experience around the topic now but would like to do more research on what happened during and post pandemic to the "digital theater" especially with participatory concepts.
  And also think and write about what I/ we came up with in the process. So maybe state-of-the-art-ish but also writing about works I was involved with?

## Task 02 - The Storyline of Your Paper

- What kinds of plant interaction exist for a performative/ installative setting?

- How can we generate real-time data from plants for audiovisual use?

- Evaluating methods of plant interaction by material cost and skill-level

## Task 03 - Research question

Evaluation of types of plant interaction for performative settings by material cost and neccessary skill.

### Feedback Lena

* I think you are in a good place with this question. It makes clear what you are going to do. 
* What do you mean with "performative settings"? You specifically want to focus on a "live", "theatrical" context, correct? Would your collaborative project be part this category? Intuitively I would say no, is that what you mean?
* For "print", I would further adjust the specific wordings. "plant interaction" is a bit misleading as it sounds to me as if the interactions come from the plants themselves. If you want to be more precise, I suggest something along the lines of (again this is not changing the topic, it is just about the wording): "Evaluation of material cost and required skills for implementing different types of human-plant interactions as part of artistic live performances." Of course only, if these terms fit to what you want to do. As I said, you are good to go to work on the question and might want to make final adjustments during the process of writing the paper.

## Task 03 - Description of a possible methodology

- Research all sorts of projects, performances, anything that make use of plant interaction. I found this paper to be a possibly fruitful starting point https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3532106.3533555
- Filter by approaches that can be used in a performative setting, aka interactions that can either be read from a continuous stream of real time data or can be read as immediate interaction data (I think these are the two main categories, but maybe this will change)
- Analyze/ categorize the results
- Develop taxonomies for the resulting options, namely money and skill, keeping a performative arts context in mind
- Summarize the findings?

## Task 04 - Description of your potential result(s) 

- A list of performances/ project that can be used for reference and inspiration
- Taxonomies that help with decision making: this is my budget and these are the people/skills available, what direction could I go in/ what is realistic to achieve?
- The taxonomies should be comprehensible and and somewhat visual and should work without the context of the paper itself

## Task 05 - Gathering literature

- [Paterns and Opportunities for the Design of Human-Plant
Interaction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3532106.3533555) paper with wide range of plant interaction in various places and nice categorization of them
- [Performing with Plants in the Ob-scene Anthropocene](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341789232_Performing_with_Plants_in_the_Ob-scene_Anthropocene) article about theater performance with plants
- [Playing with Plants](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24580497) journal article about interspecies (in this case human-plants) theatrical performances
- [Akousmaflore](https://www.scenocosme.com/akousmaflore_en.htm) documentation of a interactive, musical plant installation
- [BOTANICUS INTERACTICUS: Interactive Plants Technology](http://www.ivanpoupyrev.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/botanicus-interacticus-etech.pdf) interesting paper focusing on one interactive plant installation unsing the TOUCHE research paper
- [Sonnengarten: urban light installation with human-plant interaction](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308036116_Sonnengarten_urban_light_installation_with_human-plant_interaction) conference paper and documentation of interactive plant installation, has a good research part
