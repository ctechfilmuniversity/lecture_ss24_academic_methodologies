# Task 01 - Topic Brainstorming & Topic Selection

For my Master project idea, I want to transmit video signal in Realtime over the network. I woudl like that the signal caries a stable, high-quality and low-latency signal.
How can I achieve this? What is the best existing way to do it? Could I do it with the technologies I already know of?

All these questions are something I want to research and make use of it for my Master project.
