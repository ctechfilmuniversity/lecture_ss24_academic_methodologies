# Task 01 - Topic Brainstorming & Topic Selection

For my Master project idea, I want to transmit video signal in Realtime over the network. I woudl like that the signal caries a stable, high-quality and low-latency signal.
How can I achieve this? What is the best existing way to do it? Could I do it with the technologies I already know of?

All these questions are something I want to research and make use of it for my Master project.

Most likely I would like to focus on researching different *existing pipelines for transmitting video signals over network in realtime*

## Task 02 - The Storyline of Your Paper

On a broad sence, I would like to have a rough following storyline:

- What is low-latency?
- More on video transmission
- Tools for transmitting video signal live over network
- Use cases, benefits and downsides of those tools
- Combining and merging different techniques for improving performance and quality of my specific case, which is applicable to other things
- What is the future of this process?
- Conclusions

## Task 03 - Research question

## Task 03 - Description of a possible methodology

## Task 04 - Description of your potential result(s)
