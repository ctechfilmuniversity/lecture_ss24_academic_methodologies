# Research Document - Joel Sch√§fer



Topic II - Artistic Simulation of Living Systems in Installative Media Art. 

Description: The term Aliveness and related Theories (like Panpsychism eg.) in general. Genetic Algorithms and evolutionary Autonomous Agents Systems in specific. Open for other algorithmic approaches as well.

* What questions could you ask about that topic? 

What are the attributes that define the liveliness of an entity / an organism / eco system? 

Q1: How might attributes, connected to the liveliness of an organism be credibly imitated for enhancing the impression of liveliness in non-organic, digital actors / entities?

Q2: How can the concept of Growth & Evolution be algorithmically applied in installative artworks in the field of new media arts, to enhance impressions of a living system?

So Q1 would focus more on the single actor and how lets say some particle could be moved by some simulated forces that make his movement seem more like the movement of an actual organic being.
Q2 would focus more on the whole installation, tring to understand it as some kind of artificial ecosystem and would focus on how to make this system or the whole installation feel somewhat alive.
