## Abstract Submission

### Abstract:

Mindfulness, a traditional practice rooted in Buddhism, has gained significant attention across research, education, psychology, and technology, with numerous studies demonstrating its benefits for overall well-being. While mindfulness is often associated with formal practices like sitting meditation, it includes much more. Plum Village, a Buddhist monastery founded by Thich Nhat Hanh, the "Father of Mindfulness," emphasises integrating mindfulness into every aspect of daily life, such as walking, washing dishes, listening, and group sharing. Although technologies like mobile apps, web-based tools, VR environments have been developed to support mindfulness, they primarily focus on sitting meditation and breath awareness, neglecting the full spectrum of mindfulness practices. This paper reviews the traditional elements missing in current mindfulness technologies, identifying key trends and gaps. We provide an overview of these missing elements and propose a framework for integrating them into technology, aiming to guide future developments of more well-rounded technological mindfulness tools.



## Session 01 - Introduction

### Task 01.01 - Topic Brainstorming

Collect topics and keywords as bullet points that could be of interest to you for your paper. 

I recommend brainstorming for 20 minutes and writing down whatever comes to your mind.

*Submission:* You do not need to submit anything for this question.

    Topics and Keywords:
    
    - The relation between trash and Creative Technologies ? Create more or reduce? E-waste?

    - How is new technology affecting/relating human right  or politic?

    - How technology has helped Protest Movements? how they use tech or Communication Technology? How Technology Has Affected Protest Movements (hhttps://reporter.rit.edu/tech/how-technology-has-affected-protest-movements)
    / what kind of technologies they use/how government use technology to control people? Digital Disruption of Human Rights

    - When it comes to these new technologies, who has the advantage, governments or social movements?

    - 3D technologies for intangible cultural heritage preservation

    - How can technology help with being mindful or present



### Task 01.02 - Topic Selection

From your brainstorming output select three topics that you want to consider for your paper. Further, think about them, e.g. 

* What specifically interests you within that topic? 
* What further characteristics does the topic have? 
* What questions could you ask about that topic? 
* How could you solve those questions? 

      1 : Technological Innovations for Preserving Cantonese Opera: A Analysis of Intangible Cultural Heritage Preservation

      - Intangible cultural properties can be so many different forms such as a expression, a knowledge, music, performing arts, rituals, practice and many more. This is the tricky part as well as a interesting part. It comes with various form and how can we make use of innovation to preserve them?
      - Regarding the characteristics, we can compare traditional method and  technological innovations in preseving Cantonese Opera; the importance of the  historical role of Cantonese Opera and how it can evolve over time; how can the technology enhance the engagment with young people. 
      -  How can emerging technologies be utilized for the preservation of Cantonese Opera? In what ways can technological innovations preserving Cantonese Opera better than traditional method?
      -  I can do case studies and analye specific cases to see how technology preseve things in general.  select examples of technological innovations that have been implemented for preserving cultural properties. Analyze these case studies and   their effectiveness, impact

      2 : How Technology Has Affected Protest Movements, what kind of technologies they use during the movements?
      - After the Handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, there has been demonstrations regarding Hong Kong's Freedoms. Over the next two decades, people tried peaceful means to press for these rights, but the Hong Kong and Beijing governments have repeatedly backtracked. It eventually led to one of the massive demonstrations against the Hong Kong government. It's my personal interest in the topic.  What it surprised me is all kind of creative ways protester were used to suport the movement and aviod the traces of police. 
      - Except from the technology used during the movements, it can extend to explore how it affects movements in other countries.On the other side, how government use technology to control people would be also an interesting topic.
      - How do governments use technology for surveillance to monitor and control protest movements? How has facial recognition technology been employed by authorities to manage and suppress protests?How do governments use internet censorship and shutdowns to control the flow of information during protests?
      - It's not easy to find trusted and available information online. The most strightforwarding way is to analyze movements happen all over the world and concluse them. Looking for indepentant newspapers and compare news could be a way to go. 


      3 : How can technology help with nurishing mindfulness or being present 
      - Technology is considered as a killer to mindfulness. It fragments our attention and leads to many mental problems.  Quit oppsite, technology is a poweful and unaviodable tool which we, human, can decide how it can be used in a way benefit us. Instead of focusing on how technology destroys us, I want to explore the practice way enhance mindfulness using technology. 
      - There are a lot of aspects can be further examined. Mindfulness has been growing popular and there have been apps and websites using technonogy to help cultivating mindfuless. To reserach which tools are currently in trends or avilaible in markets can give a overal view to the development of technological mindfuless tools. Among the tools, the types of technology can be categorized.  
      - Personally I have quite some questions I want to investigate such as how to combine the traditional monastical practice with technologies, how immersive Interactive Technologies can help to nourish mindfulness, How immersive experience can nourish mindfulness and enhance the experience and etc.
      - Monastic practitioner like monks and nuns spend a lot of time practcing mindfulness. It is statistically shown thez have higher score in well-being . It can be helpful to analyze how they practice and what aspects of the practice is implemented in the exisiting mindfulness tools and what are lacked. Then I can develop prototypes of mindfulness technologies that incorporate the missing elements identified from both traditional practices and exisiting technology.


For this task, you must submit three topics, even if you have already chosen a topic for your paper.

## Session 02 - HCI
Task 02.01 - The Storyline of Your Paper
For the topics you are currently considering, write down possible (research) questions for your paper. In total you should have at least three different questions.

Don’t worry about making the question a research question. You can think of the questions also as defining the direction for the storyline of your paper.
One question represents one paper (for short papers one question is enough, each question should stand for a different paper)
Questions can refer to different topics. I recommend to develop for each topic that your are still considering, multiple questions.
Submission: Add your questions to your paper file (am_ss24_paper_lastname.md).

- Currently, I am settled with the exploring the realtionship between cultivating mindfulness and technonolgy. There are few research questions which lead to pretty different directions.

- How can emerging/immmersive technologies be implemented to enhance and promote mindfulness practice?
- What techological strategies and designe elements can be used to facilitate mindfulness, covering the aspects suh as meditation, mindful eating, breathing excerise, relaxation, Dharma sharing, and rcconecting indiviuals to the present moment?
- In what way can the combination of traditional monastical pratices and mordern technology create a way to nurtures well-being and foster a deeper connection to contemporary society?
- Explore how AI can be used to create personalized mental health and mindfulness interventions, and discuss the potential benefits and ethical considerations.
- Using VR as a tool for  Empathy Building - Can VR experiences improve emotional intelligence and social understanding?
- Examine how VR and AR technologies are being used to deliver therapeutic interventions and their potential to revolutionize mental health treatment. How Narrative VR Experiences Can Enhance Mindfulness
-

Explore how smart home technology can be used to integrate mindfulness practices into daily life, such as through ambient reminders and automated routines.


## Session 03 - Experiments

Continue to work on the research question or better the storyline for your paper.

If you submit a well-developed storyline or research question (or multiple if you are still considering different directions) before May 6th, I will give you written feedback for them before May 16th in your file. This is optional but highly recommended!

By May 16th you should have decided on ideally one, or few realistic storylines or research questions. After that date, we will start to work on “answering” the questions.
Submission: Add your questions to your paper file (am_ss24_paper_lastname.md).

## Session 04 - Statistics

It is time to think about how you want to answer the question(s) you are posing. Brainstorm which methods and/or which steps you want to apply. This task does not aim to find your personal journey of investigation. You should work on defining the approach that you will present in a paper as your methodology (but of course, you can also reflect on what you, personally, need to do to get there). If you are still considering different questions, work on all of them. This might help to make a choice between them.

Submission: 
- Case Studies: review the current use of innovative technolgoies 
- Literature review: review the exsiting literature on mindfulness techonogies and find a trend/missing element. 

## Session 05 - Qualitative Research
