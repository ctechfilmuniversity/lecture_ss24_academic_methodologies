Topics:
1. Gameplay mechanics in a specific video game genre
or
2. UX/UI Design in a specific video game genre
3. LLMs in game design (probably too hard)

What specifically interests you within that topic?
- How various games approach similar problems (for example 2D camera movement or a fishing mechanic) and implement it in different ways and how this affects the broader gameplay

What further characteristics does the topic have?
- "Game feel" (polishing the interactions to feel really satisfying)
- Understanding player psychology / player types 

What questions could you ask about that topic?
- why was a specific design chosen over another for a particular game
- what are the rules behind a mechanic, how do they compare?

How could you solve those questions?
- by taking video recordings of (if possible) the same input and comparing how the game handles this. 
- Ideally by rebuilding certain mechanics 
- by conducting interviews with the developers
