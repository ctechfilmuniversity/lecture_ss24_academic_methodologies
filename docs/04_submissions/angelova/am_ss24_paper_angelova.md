# Academic Methodologies

## Task 01.02 - Topic Selection

⚠️ Everything below are really very, very initial drafts of my brainstorming on the topic that I want to work on.

### Topic 1 - Animation and Immersive Storytelling

Something, generally in this direction. How the character design, environment design, stylization, colors, etc. are technically achieved. What are the challenges, current state-of-the-art.

I am very interested in and inspired by the paper below, which I would probably like to use for my presentation in AR II.

[Non-Photorealistic Animation for Immersive Storytelling](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-research2023-media/pubtools/pdf/a0ed9e70a833a3e3ef0ad9efc1d979b59eedb8c4.pdf)

I am also collecting here some other links, which could be useful:

- [Creating a VR Storybook Look for Rainbow Crow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uELM5qQvBkY),
- [Vertex colors and painting in the third dimension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoqDqHdBI2Y),

### Topic 2 - The Design of Characters and Environments in VR Animation

Here, my idea is to dive deeper in how the visuals are achieved for different VR animations. I am very interested in those from _Baobab Studios_. How is the viewer "put" into the story world? How the specific visual aesthetics are achieved and what is their influence on the viewer. Think about style - stylization techniques, texturing, etc., lighting techniques, colors. How can you break away from the typical CG look.

### Topic 3 - Storytelling (non-photorealistic animation) and Projection Mapping

As far as I am concerned, projection mapping is usually used for different kinds of installations, light performances, etc. I would be interested to research if this kind of technology could be used in the context of animation. More specifically, for storytelling in the format of a short animation. For example, using projection mapping on large scale objects to display a short story. It is important to mention that I am interested in non-photorealistic animations.

Another idea that pops into my mind in regard to this topic, is _how could real objects be involved in such a format_, and if using different real volumes or the specificity of the room or space, where the story is projected, could contribute to the immersiveness and overall perception of the storytelling.
