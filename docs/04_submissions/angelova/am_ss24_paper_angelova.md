# Academic Methodologies

## Task 01.02 - Topic Selection

⚠️ Everything below are really very, very initial drafts of my brainstorming on the topic that I want to work on.

### Topic 1 - Animation and Immersive Storytelling/ The Design of Characters and Environments in VR Animation

Something, generally in this direction. How the character design, environment design, stylization, colors, etc. are technically achieved. What are the challenges, current state-of-the-art. Dive deeper in how the visuals are achieved for different VR animations. I am very interested in those from _Baobab Studios_. How is the viewer "put" into the story world? How the specific visual aesthetics are achieved and what is their influence on the viewer. Think about style - stylization techniques, texturing, etc., lighting techniques, colors. How can you break away from the typical CG look.

I am very interested in and inspired by the paper below, which I would probably like to use for my presentation in AR II.

[Non-Photorealistic Animation for Immersive Storytelling](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-research2023-media/pubtools/pdf/a0ed9e70a833a3e3ef0ad9efc1d979b59eedb8c4.pdf)

I am also collecting here some other links, which could be useful:

- [Creating a VR Storybook Look for Rainbow Crow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uELM5qQvBkY),
- [Vertex colors and painting in the third dimension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoqDqHdBI2Y),

### Topic 2 - Storytelling (non-photorealistic animation) and Projection Mapping

As far as I am concerned, projection mapping is usually used for different kinds of installations, light performances, etc. I would be interested to research if this kind of technology could be used in the context of animation. More specifically, for storytelling in the format of a short animation. For example, using projection mapping on large scale objects to display a short story. It is important to mention that I am interested in non-photorealistic animations.

Another idea that pops into my mind in regard to this topic, is _how could real objects be involved in such a format_, and if using different real volumes or the specificity of the room or space, where the story is projected, could contribute to the immersiveness and overall perception of the storytelling.

### Topic 3 - Web storytelling (scrollytelling)

Write a paper, based on my first-term project.

## Task 02 - The Storyline of the Paper - Research Questions

### Topic 1 - Animation and Immersive Storytelling/ The Design of Characters and Environments in VR Animation

- What are some common challenges when creating characters and environments for VR? What strategies are employed to address these challenges?
- How does the design process for creating characters and environments in VR differ, compared to traditional mediums such as film or video games?
- What are the current trends in character and environment design for VR, and how do these trends impact the overall user experience?

### Topic 2 - Storytelling (non-photorealistic animation) and Projection Mapping

- How could spacial specificity be utilized in projection mapping for immersive animation?
- Can we further push the limits of animation with utilizing projection mapping?
- How could we enhance the engagement in non-photorealistic animation through projection mapping and real space utilization?

### Topic 3 - Web storytelling (scrollytelling)

- Chances and challenges of using the web (JavaScript, CSS) as a tool for creative visual storytelling.
- Possibilities and limitations of the web as a tool for creative visual storytelling.
- What are the possibilities of scrollytelling as a narrative tool for interactive digital children stories?
- Exploring the potential of scrollytelling in children's storytelling.
- Navigating Narratives: What is the impact of scrollytelling on children's interactive story experiences?

## Task 03 - Research Question

### 03.01

I decided to pick my third topic, since it is the one connected to my 1st term project. Therefore, I have a practical part - the scrollytelling, which could be used for experiments, doing a case-study, etc.

The question would be along the lines of:

> Chances and challenges (or advantages and challenges?) of using _conventional web technologies_ for children's interactive storytelling?

> __IMPORTANT: I have been thinking and I have some concerns regarding how scientific this topic could be and how I could do meaningful research for it, therefore I would be happy for some feedback. If it is not suitable, I have another topic suggestions below in [03.02](#0302), which are related to [Topic 1](#topic-1---animation-and-immersive-storytelling-the-design-of-characters-and-environments-in-vr-animation).__

I was thinking that I could use my project and do a real study with children (students) where they have to use it and then answer some questions, regarding their experience (of course, if all of this is feasible).

I am still not sure about a specific context, for example there are some papers, investigating the benefits of web-based stories to promote second language reading for children ([this paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10494820.2023.2202706)).

Here is a list with some questions that my paper could tackle. This is just a quick and dirty brainstorming, so some or many of the ideas below could probably sound weird or not suitable at all.

- What are the benefits, chances, pros, etc. of using conventional web technologies for interactive storytelling based on a specific case study - the scrollytelling I have implemented?
- Why is it beneficial to use the web as a storytelling medium?
- Why using conventional web technologies could be beneficial/ advantageous for web storytelling?
- Web-based stories are accessible, easy to implement, while still offering wide range of techniques
- Web-based stories offer big creative freedom
- Being accessible - both using and creating web-based stories - could make them a great tool for children to learn different skills - e.g. digital literacy, make their first steps into the world of programming in an interactive and fun way, while being creative and using real tools (web technologies)
- Using only conventional web technologies ensures that the application is lightweight, has smooth transitions, etc.
- What about accessibility? Research if this can be ensured?
- Conventional web technologies can ensure as much as possible browser compatibility?
- Web-based stories are not based on a specific operating system (this is advantageous)
- Scrolling to navigate the story makes sure that the reader is engaged?
- How multimodal and animated elements in digital narratives engage children and encourage affective and aesthetic reader response, [this paper](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ETPC-12-2014-0005/full/html) 

### 03.02

For this topic, currently, I have done a lot less research, but since I will work on a paper in the field for my presentation in Academic Readings II, I hope I will gain more knowledge. The research questions here should be along the lines of (the titles are not final ones, just summarizing the main direction of the research):

> Current trends in Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR) for VR/AR.

Or:

> Creating (empathetic) characters/environments for VR animation.

One idea is to do a review, based on the VR animations of [Baobab Studios](https://www.baobabstudios.com/films), if this is possible. Another idea is to write a survey paper, reporting current trends, state-of-the-art, etc. And I have gathered a short list of papers:

- [Non-Photorealistic Animation for Immersive Storytelling](https://research.google/pubs/non-photorealistic-animation-for-immersive-storytelling/), this is my AR paper
- [Unite Austin 2017 - Creating a VR Storybook Look for Rainbow Crow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uELM5qQvBkY)
- [Watercolor Inspired Non-Photorealistic Rendering for Augmented Reality](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/my_papers/npr_ar_2008.pdf)
- [Photorealism or/and non-photorealism in augmented reality](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1044588.1044627)
- [Presence and discernability in conventional and non-photorealistic immersive augmented reality](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6948430)
