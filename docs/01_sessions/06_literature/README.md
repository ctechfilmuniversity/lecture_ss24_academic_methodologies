## Working With Literature

Have a look at possible tools and setups to organize your collected papers. If you had to choose now, which tool or setup would you choose, why?

*Submission*: -

## Your Paper

Collect related work for your paper. List around three, ideally academic, publications that you are planning to reference in your paper. Describe briefly, how the publications are related and relevant.

*Submission*: Add references and a description of their relevance in your paper file (`am_ss24_paper_lastname.md`). Bullet points are fine.
