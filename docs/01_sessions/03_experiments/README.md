# Session 03 - Experiments

Reading the scripts and working on your paper should take < 2h. If you need longer, please let me know next class.

## Experiments

* Read [Chapter 05 - Experimental Research](../../02_scripts/am_05_experiments_script.md)


## Your Paper

Continue to work on the research question or better the storyline for your paper. 
  
If you submit a well-developed storyline or research question (or multiple if you are still considering different directions) before May 6th, I will give you written feedback for them before May 16th in your file. This is optional but highly recommended!

By May 16th you should have decided on ideally one, or few realistic storylines or research questions. After that date, we will start to work on "answering" the questions.

*Submission*: Add your questions to your paper file (`am_ss24_paper_lastname.md`).

**Happy Experimenting!**
