## Session 02 - HCI

Reading the scripts and preparing questions should take < 2h. If you need longer, please let me know next class.

* [Session 02 - HCI](#session-02---hci)
* [HCI \& Finding a Research Question](#hci--finding-a-research-question)
* [Your Paper](#your-paper)
    * [Task 02.01 - The Storyline of Your Paper](#task-0201---the-storyline-of-your-paper)



## HCI & Finding a Research Question

* Read [Chapter 04 - HCI](../../02_scripts/am_ss23_04_hci_script.md)


## Your Paper

### Task 02.01 - The Storyline of Your Paper

For the topics you are currently considering, write down possible (research) questions for your paper. In total you should have at least three different questions.

* Don't worry about making the question a *research* question. You can think of the questions also as defining the direction for the *storyline* of your paper.
* One question represents one paper (for short papers one question is enough, each question should stand for a different paper)
* Questions can refer to different topics. I recommend to develop for each topic that your are still considering, multiple questions.
  
*Submission:* Add your questions to your paper file (`am_ss24_paper_lastname.md`).
