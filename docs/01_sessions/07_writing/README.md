# Session 07 -  Academic Writing


## Academic Writing

* Read [Chapter 09 - Academic Writing](../../02_scripts/am_09_writing_script.md)

I recommend that you carefully read the chapter. You need to apply the script's content when writing your paper.

*Submission*: -

## Your Writing

Reflect on your past experiences with writing, e.g. when writing your Bachelor thesis. 

* Think about what worked well and what didn't.
* What do you think in retrospect might have helped you with the problems you faced?
* If you had to come up with a routine for yourself right now to write your e.g. your master thesis, what would it look like?

*Submission*: -


## Your Paper

Create a working title and an overview of the different sections (and sub-sections) of your paper. Name your sections appropriately. 

Decide on a LaTeX environment and set up your paper based on the given [ACS FUB 2024](../00_paper/acsfubPublStyle_2024.zip) template. Add your title and sections in the LaTeX environment and generate a proper pdf.
