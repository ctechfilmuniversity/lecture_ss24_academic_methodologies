## ACS FUB 2024

Recap [Chapter 01 - ACS FUB 2024](../../02_scripts/am_01_conference_script.md) about the final project for this class, which is a conference simulation. If you have further questions, let me know next time in class.

## Reasoning

Read [Chapter 03 - Reasoning](../../02_scripts/am_03_reasoning_script.md)

* The content is meant for a broader understanding of the topic. If you are not interested in that, you can skim the script. 

## Your Paper

### Task 01.01 - Topic Brainstorming

Collect topics and keywords as bullet points that could be of interest to you for your paper. 

I recommend brainstorming for 20 minutes and writing down whatever comes to your mind.

*Submission:* You do not need to submit anything for this question.

### Task 01.02 - Topic Selection

From your brainstorming output select three topics that you want to consider for your paper. Further, think about them, e.g. 

* What specifically interests you within that topic? 
* What further characteristics does the topic have? 
* What questions could you ask about that topic? 
* How could you solve those questions? 


For this task, you must submit three topics, even if you have already chosen a topic for your paper.
  

*Submission:* Create one file to which you add all of the preparatory work for your paper. Call this file `am_ss24_paper_lastname.md`.
