# Session 04 - Statistics

Reading the scripts and working on your paper should take < 2h. If you need longer, please let me know next class.

## Experiments

* Read [Chapter 06 - Statistics in a Nutshell](../../02_scripts/am_06_statistics_script.md)


## Your Paper

It is time to think about how you want to answer the question(s) you are posing. Brainstorm which methods and/or which steps you want to apply. This task does not aim to find your personal journey of investigation. You should work on defining the approach that you will present in a paper as your methodology (but of course, you can also reflect on what you, personally, need to do to get there). If you are still considering different questions, work on all of them. This might help to make a choice between them.
  
*Submission*: Add a description of a possible methodology in your paper file (`am_ss24_paper_lastname.md`). Bullet points are fine.
