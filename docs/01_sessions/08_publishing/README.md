# Session 08 -  Academic Publishing


## Academic Publishing

* Read [Chapter 10 - Academic Publishing](../../02_scripts/am_ss22_10_publishing_script.md)

This chapter is not that important for you at this point in your career.

## Your Paper

Write a short abstract (<= 1000 characters) for your paper. 

* You do not need to re-use this abstract later for your actual paper - but you can!  
* If you submit your abstract by July 4th, I will have a look at it and give you feedback before July 12th.

*Submission*: Add the abstract to your paper file (`am_ss24_paper_lastname.md`).
