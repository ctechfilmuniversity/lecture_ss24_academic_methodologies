## Quality Assessment


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* What is the common scientific approach to a quality assessment?
* 
--

Peer review is based on the technique that people from the same research community with similar competencies and expertise evaluate the work of a peer.  

--

It functions as a form of self-regulation by qualified members of the community.

## Bibliometrics


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* What are Bibliometrics?

--

Bibliometrics is the use of statistical methods for quality measures to analyse  

* Journals
* Conferences
* Authors

Impact factor (IF), h-index, i10 index


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* The impact factor (IF) or journal impact factor is an index that reflects the yearly average number of citations that articles published in the last two years in a given journal received. 
* The h-index is an author-level metric that attempts to measure both the productivity and citation impact of the publications of a scientist or scholar.

## Problems With The Current System

.task[COMMENT:]  

* What can be seen as the main problems?

--

* Accessibility
* Quality

## Problems With The Current System


* Accessibility
    * Free labor from universities / large margin for private publishing houses
    * Access fees are high
    * Alternative: open access strategies
--
* Quality
    * Review results might be close to random
    * Only positive results are publishable


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* A possible solution are so called *open access* venues. The general idea is that the authors themselves pay for publications and to access those papers is free.

## Is a Phd For You?

Some excerpts of the reviews I got over time... Ouch! üòî 

* I was completely **disappointed by** [‚Ä¶]
* The results of this paper are **not reasonable**.
* This paper is disappointing as it **lacks novelty**.
* [‚Ä¶] the paper describes a longer list of minor changes to an existing algorithm. [‚Ä¶] reuses a lot of established concepts [‚Ä¶] **does not seem to lead to fundamental new insights** or **significant technical challenges**.
* This paper does not seem to advance the state-of-the-art in any way. 
*  [‚Ä¶] would **not** consider the paper **a major practical break-through**.
* I'm not very enthusiastic about the paper [‚Ä¶]

## Is a Phd For You?

Some excerpts of the reviews I got over time... Ouch! üòî 

* [‚Ä¶] make the results **hardly meaningful**.
* I am **skeptical of the value** of the presented studies.
The problem addressed in the paper **does not seem very new** and the proposed algorithms also **do not offer any particular insights**. Therefore, I think this paper **is not significant enough**.
* The manuscript also fails to present the (rather simple) technique in a concise (and correct) way. 
* [‚Ä¶] **makes no sense**.
